### Customer Churn Analysis with Tableau

This repository contains the analysis and visualizations I have created in Tableau. 

## The data
Databel consists of 29 columns and has one row per customer. The analysis is based on a snapshot of the database at a specific moment in time, so there is no time dimension.

## Visualization
This dataset was analyzed and condensed into a story illustrating the impact of these variables on the different dimensions of the dataset. The results can be viewed in Tableau Public [via this link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shamanth.hegde/viz/CustomerChurnAnalysis_17085237111820/CHURNANALYSIS)
